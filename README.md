Adaptive Multi-Technique Redirected Walking for Constrained VR on Meta Quest 3



An interactive Godot 4.3 demo of adaptive redirected walking on Meta Quest 3. Users calibrate perceptual gains, then explore a physical play area with:

- **Discrete rotations** via controller‑trigger taps  
- **Continuous curvature** redirecting your path  
- **Out‑of‑place resets** when you near the physical boundary  
- A **meta‑strategy** that switches techniques in real time  


## Features ##

- **Calibration UI** for individual rotation, translation & curvature gains  
- **Action Zones** that trigger discrete rotations when you walk into them  
- **Continuous curvature** module to subtly bend your path  
- **One‑step resetting** to teleport you back when you cross the boundary  
- **Meta‑strategy manager** that chooses the optimal technique based on your position  
- **LocomotionController** for smooth/snap turning and hand‑directed steering
